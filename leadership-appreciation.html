<div class="poem center-text">Yet more always comes.<br />
The days grow longer and tired,<br />
but when did the night appear so quickly?<br />
Though we still descend,<br />
splintered buckets reaching to drink from their own wells.<br />
<br />
But a longer rope, a brighter morning<br />
held by those who give, then given.<br />
Bring forth cups of water or coffee or beer<br />
now pressed to our mouths; shake off the fading year.<br />
Take us on through night and Winter and newer storms,<br />
and even striving within the smallest moments of laughter or grief.<br />
<br />
This gratitude begins in words, the little signs of changing seasons—<br />
the first cooler breeze bearing orange banners,<br />
the first flash of green in March.<br />
They’ll continue growing into something that you will always know<br />
arrives with the same steadfast certainty<br />
as the more that always comes.

<p class="center-text">I am still new but this this is by far and above the best group of people I’ve had the privilege of being lead by. I <i>really</i> appreciate the fact that management can do a phenomenal job of taking care of the customer’s high level needs while simultaneously taking great care in the management of their subordinates; these 2 things do not often go hand in hand in my experience. Thank you to the entire team for making ‘work’ enjoyable, even when the sky is falling. - Matt T</p>

<p class="center-text">Our Support Leaders are truly that, Leaders who inspire you to follow them, who inspire you to do&nbsp;your best, and who mentor you so&nbsp;you can get there. It is truly amazing to work with and learn from each and every one of you. - LB</p>

<p class="center-text">Your leadership and guidance make ClickDimensions a great place to work. Thank you for all of your time and energy! -Allison Fierce</p>

<p class="center-text">Thank you for all you do for the entire office! The teams are stronger because of the sacrifices you make, and it has not gone unnoticed. Thank you again! -Elizabeth</p>

<p class="center-text">Thanks for everything! During this hard time, you all had our backs and it made a huge difference. We couldn't have survived it without you all.</p>

<p class="center-text">As a new member of ClickDimensions, this thanks goes to the whole leadership team. Thank you everyone for the warm welcome as well as your time and patience. I know it can be difficult training newbies when things are a bit hectic but everyone has taken the time to share your knowledge and experience in order to help us grow. It's been great so far and I'm looking forward to seeing what's next!</p>
<span style="color:BE1E2D;">Specific Shout Outs</span>

<p class="center-text">Marissa is so supportive - of both her own team members and other MSMs, as well. She's never too busy to help anyone.</p>

<p class="center-text">Julie's been great juggling multiple roles and always stepping in where the team needs her most. As a manager, I always appreciate her transparency.</p>

<p class="center-text">Shawn is fearless at throwing himself on top of the worst grenades that support has to offer;&nbsp;truly a leader that will not ask you to do anything he is not willing to do himself, which is rare and admirable - LB</p>

<p class="center-text">Julie, thanks for always being so helpful and approachable! Super grateful to have you as my team lead. -Emily</p>

<p class="center-text">Thank you, Julie, for all your support. I know you were running on empty but in spite of that, you still were there solving every problem that you could. I appreciate your leadership and the opportunity to work with you--you've taught me much.</p>
