       <h1>ClickDimensions Wiki</h1>
<p>The ClickDimensions Wiki houses information from the Dev, Product, and Customer teams. It is designed to give the Customer team information needed to troubleshoot or otherwise support our customers.</p>

 <h2>Using the Wiki</h2>
 <p>When youa access the Wiki, you'll see a list of sections available. Our documentation is housed in the Features section. Each page under that Features section belongs to a different area of product functionality so you can view a specific page and look for the information you need. You can also use the Wiki search bar and it will pull up all mentions of the search terms that you enter. Please keep in mind that it will search all pages on the wiki so you may see some pages that are intended more for Dev's internal documentation and not ours.</p>
 
 <h2>Requesting updates to the Wiki</h2>
 <p>If you notice that we're missing some documentation on a particular feature, or have done testing and can confirm how a particular scenario plays out, in the Slack wiki_discussion channel, type a message @clickiwiki and include your request/update. Slack will ping all the wiki team members and one of them will handle your message.</p>
